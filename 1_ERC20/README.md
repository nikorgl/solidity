Contract address:
https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0xace294036fE7546e6bB8288Ea17ebc7287Bb7E2b

## Task
Write an ERC-20 standard token
- Implement all the basic functionality of the contract. Do not inherit from Open Zeppelin and other libraries and do not copy the code
- Add mint and burn functions
- Write full-fledged tests to the contract
- Write a deployment script
- Upload to the test network
- Write tasks on transfer, transferFrom, approve
- Verify the contract

Requirements
- All ERC-20 tokens in the network must meet the standard described in the eip.
- Contain the full set of functions from EIP.
- The implementation of logic and the responsibility for correctness lies with you, however, the network is full of examples of ERC20 tokens, where you can see how the implementation of such tokens usually looks like.
